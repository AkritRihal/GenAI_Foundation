**Indian Summer**  

Golden hues in autumn's light,  
A lingering warmth, soft and bright.  
Summer whispers one last tune,  
Beneath the harvest moon.  

Amber leaves drift, slow and free,  
Dancing with the restless breeze.  
Sun-kissed fields in golden glow,  
As rivers in warm currents flow.  

Crickets sing in twilight's hold,  
Days still burn, though nights grow cold.  
A fleeting touch, a final ember,  
The heart of summer—sweet September.  

Nature’s breath, a soft delay,  
Before the chill calls it away.  
A dream of warmth, a sunlit gleam,  
An autumn kissed by summer’s dream.
